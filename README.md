# Challenge 21.2 – Predicting Upgrades

## Background

TracFone’s customers draw from diverse and vibrant backgrounds. For example, they may be proudly pragmatic who appreciate good value mobile service plans. Alternatively, they may be travelers that are temporarily visiting friends or family or forming new memories on their vacation to take home with them. They may even belong to financially fragile communities that have traditionally been underserved by the large wireless providers that required credit checks and long-term contracts. Ever since our inception in 1996, our focus has always been on providing coverage and access for all. 

TracFone was a pioneer in the USA market to offer mobile phones and plans without extensive credit requirements, making smartphones accessible to a wider part of the community. Beyond the cellular network, the phone device has an important impact on the customer’s experience. One of our challenge at Tracfone is to ensure we are able to anticipate our customer’s need for an upgrade to their device.

## Objective

The 21.2 challenge is to use machine learning to predict customers ready for a device upgrade. TracFone offers customers mobile phones to go with the plans from feature phones, to Apple iPhones and Android smartphones. An aging device where the battery is loosing its ability to retain charge may keep running out of battery when the customer needs it most. Meanwhile certain customer’s usage and lifestyles may be better catered with the latest mobile phone. Furthermore a grandmother who is accustomed to her mobile phone may not be comfortable getting a new device.

If we can accurately predict when a customer is ready for an upgrade, we can ensure that only the customers looking to upgrade their device do in fact get the offer to upgrade their device. Proactively anticipating and serving our customer’s needs for a new device will ensure a good experience for our customers.
