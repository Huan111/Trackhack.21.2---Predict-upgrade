We include 4 pieces of code in our submission. These are the main pieces of code that informed out decisions.

- `final_submission.ipynb`
    - This is the final submission we made. This includes the feature extraction, as well as the model trainin step.
    - Since this was our final submission, we removed all data exploration and machine learning testing steps, and include only the best findings out of all of them.
    - The code has also been cleaned for
- `feature_extraction_1.py`
    - This is our first attempt at feature extraction, which did not perform well.
- `feature_extraction_2.ipynb`
    - This is the feature extraction used in our final submission.
    - It contains some data exploration as well.
- `parameter_tuning.ipynb`
    - Code used in tuning the parameters of several machine learning algorithms.
